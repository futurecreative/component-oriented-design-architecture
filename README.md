> An experimental methodology that integrates design intent with component architecture. Early stage development - feedback and contributions welcome.

## What is CODA?

CODA (Component-Oriented Design Architecture) is an experimental development methodology that attempts to solve the problem of maintaining design integrity while enabling content flexibility in modern web applications. 

**Current Status**: Early experimental phase. This evolved from DICA (Design-Intent Content Architecture) and is still being refined through real-world usage.

### The Problem We're Trying to Solve

Traditional component architectures often struggle with:
- Design drift when content changes
- Scattered implementation across multiple files  
- Unclear design constraints
- Difficulty testing design intent alongside functionality

### The CODA Approach (Experimental)

CODA tries to address this by:
- Putting everything related to a component in one module
- Making design constraints explicit and enforceable
- Providing runtime validation during development
- Using clear interfaces for both technical and design contracts

## The Evolution: DICA â†’ CODA

This methodology evolved from some earlier work:

### DICA (v0 - The Starting Point)
Started with the idea that content should be classified based on its relationship to design:
- **Component-Owned**: Content tightly coupled with design
- **Content-Injected**: Content that varies but has design constraints  
- **Data-Driven**: Content that's purely informational

### CODA (v0.1 - Current Experiment)
Combined DICA's content patterns with module-based architecture principles:
- Module-based organization
- Service registries for testing
- Decorator patterns for extension
- Theme integration
- Runtime validation

**Note**: This is still very experimental. We're testing these ideas and seeing what works in practice.

## Quick Example

Here's what a basic CODA component looks like right now:

```tsx
// FeatureCard.tsx - Content-Injected Pattern
export interface IFeatureCard {
  render(): JSX.Element;
  updateContent(props: Partial<FeatureContent>): void;
  readonly constraints: { title: { maxLength: number }; };
}

const DESIGN_INTENT = {
  pattern: "Content-Injected",
  purpose: "Show features with consistent layout",
  constraints: { title: { maxLength: 30 } }
};

class FeatureCardImpl implements IFeatureCard {
  // Implementation with validation...
}

// Service registry
const registry = new WeakMap<object, IFeatureCard>();
export function getFeatureCard(key = {}, content?): IFeatureCard {
  if (!registry.has(key)) {
    registry.set(key, new FeatureCardImpl(content));
  }
  return registry.get(key)!;
}

// React wrapper
export const FeatureCard: React.FC<{title?: string}> = (props) => {
  const card = getFeatureCard({}, props);
  return card.render();
};
```

## Current Status & Limitations

**What's Working:**
- Basic pattern classification
- Module structure seems helpful
- Runtime validation catches some issues

**What Needs Work:**
- Testing strategies are still being figured out
- Performance implications unknown
- Migration path from existing code is unclear
- Not sure how well this scales

**Known Issues:**
- WeakMap registry might have memory implications
- Decorator pattern adds complexity
- Not tested with large teams yet

## Contributing

This is experimental work and we'd love feedback! If you:
- Try this approach and it works/doesn't work
- Have ideas for improvements  
- Find bugs or issues
- Think this is completely wrong

Please open an issue or discussion. We're still figuring this out.

## Roadmap (Tentative)

### v0.2 (Maybe)
- [ ] Real-world testing with a few projects
- [ ] Better examples and documentation
- [ ] Figure out performance implications

### v0.3 (If v0.2 works)
- [ ] Proper testing strategies
- [ ] Migration tools/guides
- [ ] Community feedback integration

### v1.0 (Way in the future)
- [ ] Only if this actually proves useful in practice
