# Changelog

Tracking changes to this experimental methodology.

## [Unreleased]
- Figuring out what actually works in practice

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- Initial experimental release
- Three patterns from DICA work: Component-Owned, Content-Injected, Data-Driven
- Module structure combining interface, implementation, styling, constraints
- Basic runtime validation for development
- Service registry pattern (might be overkill)
- Decorator pattern for extensions (definitely might be overkill)
- Some documentation and examples

### Changed from DICA
- Added module-based organization
- Moved from pure content focus to unified architecture
- Added more TypeScript interfaces and structure

### Known Issues
- Not tested at scale
- Performance implications unknown
- Might be overengineered
- Need better examples

## [0.0.x] - DICA Era

### What Led Here
- Started with DICA (Design-Intent Content Architecture)
- Content classification based on design relationship
- Team collaboration patterns
- Realized needed better code organization
- Combined with microservice-in-a-file thinking
- Ended up with this experiment
